I've noticed a lack of readilly-available templates that mark the precise locations of the file and folder textures. As such, I've decided to create some myself to hopefully motivate others to create their own textures!

The only ones that may need explainantion are the file textures, as only the right isde is actually textured; the left isde is mirrored from the right.

Other than that, the folder textures are self-explainatory.

Have fun creating custom theme textures!
